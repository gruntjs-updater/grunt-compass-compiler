grunt-compass-compiler
======================

Compass compiler with support for multiple config.rb targets.

Better README coming real soon. For now, see the project's own Gruntfile.js for an example of how to use the task.

notes
=====
* Windows support is predictably absent
* You must have Compass in your system PATH or this task won't work
